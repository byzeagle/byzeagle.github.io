	<h2>Finite Space Construction (Proof of outer space is finite)</h1>
	<p>I wrote a paper thats explains how an infinite number of points constitutes a finite space and that infinite spaces are mathematically undefined.</p>
	<a href="./Finite_Space_Construction.pdf">Here is the paper</a>
	<p>\(n/(x-1)\) is an extremely simple function that super-smart Turkish students don't bother to take its limit (it's not worth their effort). But it models a real physical phenomena and therefore gives results as far as to defining infinite space's nature.</p>
	<p>Functions alone are not much. They are tied to facts and phenomenas in real life. Turkish students deal with the hardest functions without knowing why they exist. The best student is the one who solves the hardest question without a need for a proper understanding of fundamental nature of functions.
	You can explain the most important phenomenas with simplest functions given that you realize and model the behaviour right. The fact is the most complex functions that the Turkish students solve are usually meaningless, meaning that they do not correspond to a fact. 
	Millions of people (while they were young) wasted their lives with meaningless functions in Turkiye (and they still do). The thing about high school mathematics is not to solve the most complex functions though. 
	Really few of these people who solve complex math questions take part in math olympiads and a handful of them get medals. Most of these people mostly end up wasting their time for no outcome in life.</p>
	<p>You don't have to close the gaps with \(x-1\). You can fully close them with any way you want with any function with limits. I also used \(2^x\) to close the gaps.
	The trick here is to make gaps get equally smaller. All gaps have to have equal length while getting smaller equally.</p>
	<a href="./function.pdf">Here is the illustration</a>
	<p>If you have read the results section of Finite Space Construction paper, it says that infinite spaces are undefined. I want to further explain that. It says finite spaces are defined because
	the limit tends to a definite value - which is zero, meaning that gaps between all consecutive points fully close. However, if the length is infinite, then the limit becomes an indeterminate form - which is an already known entity in mathematics. 
	What does that indeterminate form mean in terms of physical spaces? What does it say? That's the hard part. \(\infty/\infty\) has no definitive value and it can evaluate to different values such as \(0\), a finite number or \(\infty\).
	\(\infty/\infty\) itself does not tell us anything. Existing mathematics says further evaluation is needed to decide the limit but in this case further evaluation is not possible. So we end up in a situation in which there is no definite value that tells 
	us what the distance is between all consecutive points. Such unknown should not correspond to anything physical, it is undefined. When spaces are finite, you have something concrete and real, but when you claim they are infinite, you end up with a no definite answer where further evalution is not possible.
	Space as we perceive it is finite. What lies beyond a finite space or what infinite space is is beyond my understanding.</p>

	<p>Since space is finite, coordinate system is finite. Here is the confusing part though, when x-axis is finite, limits should not reach infinity (there is no graph that extends infinitely where the limit can reach infinity), 
	which makes building a finite space not possible. But this is a paradox. You need to reach infinity to build a finite space but that, in turn, means limits cannot approach infinity.</p>

	<p>Finite space construction isn't the only proof that outer space is finite. The other proof is much simpler and requires less rigorous analysis. You can multiply a finite line (a finite space)
	with any real number and the result is finite but not with infinity and that is the answer.</p>

	<p>We have proved that even with limits theoretically reaching infinity, there is no infinite length (in terms of spaces, a space of any dimension is always finite). That, in turn, suggests limits do not approach infinity.
	But \(n/(x-1)\) still holds true even when there is no limit that reaches infinity. The statement holds true with any finite number given the fact that there is always a gap between all consecutive points. 
	We assumed that infinity existed and proved that there is no infinity even with that assumption. Matter seems continuous but there are gaps between atoms. It could be as well that the space itself
	isn't continuous. I say this because for something to be continuous, infinity as a concept needs to exist. I am not a hundred percent sure on this though. I am trying to get rid of the paradox that is arisen from
	finite spaces and limits approaching infinity. What's interesting is that this all leads to the fact that the real number set is finite, meaning that you cannot get infinitely small or big.</p>

	<h2>Improper integrals are Undefined</h2>
	<p>I wrote a paper that explains why improper integrals do not exist.</p>
	<a href="./Improper_Integrals_are_Undefined.pdf">Here is the paper.</a>
	<p>\[ \int_{\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \,dx = 1\]</p>
	<p>If you have read the paper, you will know that the integral, as it is used in probability density functions (PDFs), is not technically meaningful by the definition of integral.</p>
	<p>You would see that the integral will never take on the value 1 because integrals with infinite boundaries are undefined. If you want to use \(\infty\) notation, you should drop \(dx\), and should come up with a new concept.</p>
	<p>\[\displaystyle {\widehat {f}}(\xi ) = \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(x)\ e^{-i2\pi \xi x} \,dx, \quad \forall \xi \in \mathbb {R} .\]</p>
	<p>Fourier transform in its current from is not meaningful. Furthermore, you cannot numerically precisely compute an integral and take its limit to infinity. But fourier transform is useful and works within finite boundaries.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, though, if rectangles (instead of \(dx\)) are used to approximate the integral, there will be an infinite number of rectangles between an infinite boundary - where there is no ambiguity as there is with \(dx\).</p>

	<h2>Thoughts on Error Margin in Integral and Derivative</h2>
	<p>To eliminate error margin in derivative and integral, you need to reach infinity with limits. However, such use is not feasible in numerical computations. But you need to consider the fact that error margin could be as low as you wish it to be, and practical applications always tolerate error margin. Therefore, you can numerically compute derivative and integral in computers with adequate error margin. 
	It is not possible to eliminate error margin in numerical computations because you cannot reach infinity, multiply (integral) or divide (derivative) by zero.</p>

	<p>\[ \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) * \frac{b-a}{n}\]</p>
	<p>\[f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\]</p>

	<p>When you want to use the above formulas numerically in computers, you cannot divide by zero in the derivative definition or you cannot multiply by zero in the integral definition; however, 
	you can place any value as small as you want in order to bring the error margin to the desired value. Considering practical applications always tolerate an error margin, you need not fully get rid of it.
	The important thing about symbolic mathematics is that you need to know the exact value of a derivative or an integral to be able to decide the error margin. 
	But practical applications will always tolerate error margins that come as a result of numerical computations.</p>

	<p>Therefore, we can say that numerical computations with error margins as low as we wish will always be adequate for practical applications.
	Symbolic math exists so that we can get precise values but nothing is precise in everyday applications.</p>

	<h2>Information on Turkish for people who speak Indo-European languages</h2>
	<p>Turkish is heavily reliant on suffixes. You need to correctly hear and understand suffixes in order to understand Turkish. Modal verbs, tenses are all suffixes in Turkish. Auxiliary verbs as
	they are present in English are not present in Turkish. Turkish have no genders and adjectives do not change based on that. Turkish does have grammatical cases that are independent of genders and you need to know them correctly.
	However, the way they are taught in Turkish schools and language is completely different than how they are taught in Indo-European languages and European schools, therefore most Turks
	educated in Turkish schools fail to correctly understand Indo-European languages. Turkish has a strange way expressing the past that is not present in Indo-European languages.
	Relative pronouns are not present in Turkish language as they are present in Indo-European languages. Turkish instead uses something called verbal adjectives with suffixes added to convey
	the same meaning. Turkish uses postpositions added as suffixes to the words instead of prepositions. Furthermore, the language uses subject-object-verb order but it is quite flexible like in Russian or German
	because of the case system present in the language. The only difference is that Turkish case system is independent of grammatical genders. Turkish creates challenges in understanding that are not
	present in Indo-European languages to due to heavy combinations of suffixes that totally alter the meaning. Even Turks themselves have trouble understanding their own materials at times. 
	Turkish uses simple past for many actions including those that are expressed with present perfect. It has a second form of past that is not present in Indo-European languages and is hard to grasp for Indo-European speakers. 
	You can't use infinitive clause to imply a purpose in Turkish. You need to explicitly use "for" in order to convey the same meaning. For example, you say "I came home for to eat". Saying "I came home to eat" will be unintelligible.
	Turkish language uses the same numbers as Kazakh, Turkmen, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Azeri and other Turkic Siberian languages. If you know numbers in Turkish, you will understand numbers everywhere. Turkish numbers are quite systematic and easy.
	Azeri is quite intelligible to Turkish speakers, Turkmen and Uzbek are also fairly intelligible but you need to give some effort to be able to understand the Kazakh language. You can't understand Mongolian, Korean or Japanese if you already know Turkish.
	It is quite easy to read in Turkish because each letter represents a distinct sound (but there are a few exceptions). You combine pronunciation of each letter and you get a complete word. Suffixes aren't separated from the root word in the written language unless the word fullfills certain
	criterias such as being a name of a place or a person or an organization. Turkish grammar rules all revolve around suffixes and their accordance with the root word. You don't think in terms of genders in Turkish, everything is genderless.
	Postpositions in Turkish are relatively easier than prepositions in Indo-European languages and are quite straightforward and that's the main reason why Turkish speakers fail to correctly use prepositions in Indo-European languages.
	Turkish grammar is quite systematic and you can use it like a robot but people won't find it nice. Turkish does not have definite articles, therefore Turkish speakers always fail to correctly use definite articles in other languages.
	Understanding the root word is never enough in Turkish, you need to understand the word as a whole with all the distinct meanings of each suffix - but that creates challenges in understanding that are not present in Indo-European languages.
	And it becomes a real problem when you have many words like this in a sentence. The longer a sentence becomes, the more problematic it is. Translations between Indo-European languages are solid, however, translations between Indo-European languages 
	and Turkish miss some really important context at times. Certain things are impossible to express. You need to express them the way Indo-European speakers will understand.</p>

	<p>Turkish language has its weaknesses and strengths like all other languages. Some things are definitely more fun to express in Turkish if you understand Turkish at a native level. 
	It is hard to speak Turkish or express yourselves if you have a regular American-British mentality. The real strength of Turkish lies in daily life, not in scientific or technical topics.
	Actually, Turkish is quite weak when it comes to scientific and technical topics although they tried very hard to catch up with the developed nations. In fact, Turkish made some really stupid
	attempts to turkify names that had Persian, Greek, Arabic, French, English or other origins. Turkish has tons of loanwords from other languages but Turkish republic at some point attempted to 
	turkify their names. Turks speak and think with a different mentality than Western nations and it takes time to get used to it. Turkish is a rich language that allows people to express themselves in their daily lives.
	Turks are not particularly good at science, so Turkish, the language that belongs to Turkish society, fails to adequately express scientific and technical topics. But that does not mean it is a simple and primitive language, 
	it is actually quite successful in helping people express themselves in their daily lives whether it be funny topics, needs, emotions, society problems, etc. Turks mostly fail to express their emotions that belong to Turkish society in other languages.</p>

	<p>Extra knowledge: In German you modify the adjective or the article to express grammatical case. In Russian, you modify the noun and adjectives together. Turkish does not modify adjectives, there is no
	agreement between adjective and the noun it modifies, instead, you only need to modify noun with suffixes to express the case. Turkish has another past tense that is not present in Indo-European languages
	that you use to express a past you indirectly know about. They simply call it "heard past".</p>

	<p>Both in English and Turkish, you get to use the semantics that correspond to modal verbs and tenses with the main verb, they are not separated. However, in German, tenses and modal verbs
	are seperated from the main verb, thus creating an unnecessary confusion that isn't present in English, Russian and Turkish.</p>
	
	<h2>The Hizmet Kids are excellent gamblers</h2>
	<p>The Hizmet kids are excellent gamblers because getting a good place in OSYM's university entrance exam is a gambling. It is extremely hard to be in the first 1000 and be placed in a
	bachelor's degree that falls within that range. Gambling is forbidden in Turkiye (I don't like the name "Turkey" since it creates ambiguity in the meaning), but the Hizmet kids and the remaining Turkish kids 
	who fall within first 1000 range are excellent gamblers. There is such an intense competition that you will never get in there unless you get lucky. If you are not a successful gambler, you will never be there.
	The thing is you can be the smartest student out there but you need to take risks in order to get something out of the exam. Considering China's and India's population, Chinese and Indian students are world-class gamblers.
	The best of them all end up in casinos in Las Vegas.</p>

	<h2>Hint-Avrupa dil ailesine ve İngilizceye özgü bilmeniz gereken grammer yapıları</h2>
	<p>İngilizcede iyi anlamanız gereken ve Türkçeden farklı bir kaç grammar yapısı vardır ve bunlar hemen hemen her yerde kullanılır. Bunlardan bir tanesi yardımcı fiil (auxiliary verb) konseptidir ve diğeri ise modal verb konseptidir. Yardımcı fiil İngilizce dilinde hemen hemen her yerde kullanılır ve Türkçeden farklı bir mentalitede kullanılır. Modal fiiller ise Türkçe dilinde fiillere eklenen eklerle sağlanan olasılık, izin, beceri gibi kavramları ifade etmek için kullanılır. Türkçede modal fiillerin ve yardımcı fiillerin direkt karşılığı yoktur. Hint-Avrupa dillerinde Türk dilinden farklı olan başka birşey de Hint-Avrupa dilleri 'relative pronoun' denilen bir yapıyı kullanırlar. Türkçede buna anlamsal olarak karşılık gelen yapı sıfat-fiildir fakat Hint-Avrupa dilleri bunun yerine 'relative pronoun' denen yapıyı kullanır.</p>
